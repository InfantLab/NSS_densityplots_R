# NSS_densityplots_R
### Visualising National Student Survey data year on year

CC0 Caspar Addyman  2018

A set of scripts that takes the large spreadsheet of National Student Survey data for all psychology departments and plots the responses to each question as density plot. It shows the relative position of Goldsmiths for this year. And overlays last years scores too. 

A second part of the script does the same but comparing just to other london universities.
